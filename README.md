# GitHub API Integration with AI Analysis Support

This project was developed as part of the **Full Stack Intern (AI Focus)** task at **Smarter Minds**.

It integrates the **GitHub API** with an **AI-powered analysis feature**, allowing users to fetch repository data and generate AI-based insights.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** ShadCN + Tailwind CSS
- **AI Model:** `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free` via **OpenRouter API**

---

## AI Integration

The AI analysis feature uses the **Mistral-7B Instruct (Free Model)** through OpenRouter.

> ⚠️ Since the model is free, it may experience **queueing delays** or **slow responses**.  
> In such cases, you may need to **wait a few seconds** or **re-generate** the analysis.

---

## Features

- Fetch GitHub user data and repositories.
- Analyze repositories using AI.
- Compare two GitHub users with key metrics (e.g., total repositories, followers, top languages, and activity).
- View local notes for each repository (stored in browser localStorage).
- Clean and intuitive UI inspired by popular AI tools.

---

## UI Inspiration

The user interface design is **inspired by modern AI tools**, focusing on clarity, responsiveness, and minimalism.
